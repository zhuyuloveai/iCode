# Configure approval modes

When an agent makes a tool call, such as running a Shell command or writing a file, iCode may require approval first. This guide explains how to choose an approval mode and handle approval requests in the terminal user interface (TUI), as well as how approval settings differ across ways of running iCode.

## Understand the three approval modes

The approval mode determines how iCode handles tool calls that require approval. Which calls require approval depends on both the `approval` policy in the agent profile and iCode's safety rules. See the [approval field in the agent profile reference](../../reference/agent-profile.md#approval).

The three approval modes behave as follows:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| MANUAL | Tool calls that require approval open a dialog and wait for a person to approve or decline. |
| AUTO | An approval judge model evaluates tool calls. Calls judged safe are approved automatically; suspicious calls are flagged for a person to decide. |
| BYPASS | Tool calls run without asking, even when the agent configuration or safety rules require approval. |

**Approval judge model**: In automatic mode, iCode calls the approval judge model and sends it the current time, the workspace directories, all user prompts of the current turn and the latest of them, and the tool name, tool kind, and arguments. By default, the approval judge uses the current session's model. To change it, press **F10** to open **Settings**, select the **Models & Agents** tab, and change **Approval judge model** in the **Model roles** section.

> **Tip**
>
> **Manual mode does not mean every tool call opens a dialog.** It means that calls requiring approval are decided by the user. Calls that do not require approval or qualify for automatic approval run directly. See [Understand automatic approval and safety protections](#understand-automatic-approval-and-safety-protections).

## Switch approval modes in the TUI

Use either of these methods to switch the current approval mode in the TUI:

- Type `/approval` in the input field, then press **Space** or **Enter** to open the approval mode list and choose a mode. You can also specify a mode directly, for example `/approval auto`.
- Click the approval mode label in the upper-right corner of the interface and choose a mode in the **Approval Mode** dialog.

You can switch modes while a task is running. Approval requests that are already open are unaffected; subsequent tool calls use the new mode.

### Set the default approval mode

With the default settings unchanged, the TUI starts in manual approval mode on its first launch. Switching the current approval mode also updates the default for the next launch: choosing manual or automatic mode saves that mode as the default. Choosing bypass mode applies only to the current run; to avoid continuing to bypass approval protections after a restart, the default for the next launch is saved as automatic mode.

To change only the default for the next launch without changing the current approval mode, press **F10** to open **Settings** and change **Default approval mode** on the **Security** tab. **Settings** does not offer bypass mode as a default that can be saved.

## Handle approval requests in the TUI

Tool calls that require approval open an **Approval Required** dialog showing the tool name and call arguments. For file edits, it also shows the planned diff so you can review changes before they are made.

- Press **Y** to approve or **N** to decline, or click the corresponding button. You cannot close the dialog with **Esc**; you must explicitly approve or decline.
- When declining, you can provide a reason. The reason is sent to the agent to help it adjust its next steps. Once a reason is entered, the approve button is disabled.
- In automatic mode, no dialog opens while the approval judge model evaluates a call; **Reviewing** appears, after a spinning icon, to the left of the approval mode label in the upper-right corner. Calls the model judges safe run without a dialog. If the model judges a call suspicious, the dialog opens with the title **Flagged by Auto-Review**, shows the reason, and waits for a person to decide. The cursor starts in the reason field so that a stray key press does not approve the call: type a reason and decline, or press **Tab** to move to the buttons. If the approval judge model is unavailable, or evaluation fails or times out, the dialog opens for a person to decide instead of approving the tool call automatically.
- To see each call while it is evaluated, press **F10** to open **Settings** and turn off **Show the approval dialog only when Auto-Review flags a call** on the **Security** tab. The dialog then opens at once and shows **Evaluating**: it closes by itself if the model judges the call safe, and you can approve or decline before evaluation finishes.

## Remember approvals

You can let iCode remember a Shell command or a file change you approve, so the same request does not ask you again. The approval dialog for a Shell command or a file write or edit shows a **Remember Approval** box:

1. Check **Don't ask again for this command** (for files: **Don't ask again to modify these files**).
2. Choose **This session** or **This project**. **This session** also applies after you restore the session; **This project** also applies in your other sessions in the same project.
3. Select **Approve**.

The next time the agent makes the same request, it runs without a dialog. Only that command, or those files, are remembered; other operations still ask. Approving without checking the box approves this one call only. A few cases are never remembered:

- A call that the approval judge model approves in automatic mode. A call that Auto-Review flags still offers the box, and you can remember it when you approve it.
- A request you edit in the dialog: the edited call runs once.
- A command for which the agent names the folder to run in, and requests that touch sensitive files such as credentials or SSH keys.
- Sub-agents, workflows, MCP tools and other tools.

If a folder or file link changes between your approval and the run, so that the call would act on a different place, the call stops with an error instead of running there.

For a simple command, **Advanced options** offers **Allow arguments added to the end of this command**. Then the remembered command also runs without asking when the agent adds more arguments to its end. Remembering `git push origin main` this way also allows `git push origin main --force`, so the dialog shows a warning. Leave this unchecked unless you trust every argument that could be added.

If iCode cannot save your choice, the call still runs once and a notice says that the approval was not remembered.

### Manage remembered approvals

Use the `icode approvals` command to see and remove what you have remembered:

```bash
icode approvals list                         # everything you have remembered
icode approvals list --project /work/demo    # only one project
icode approvals list --session SESSION_ID --json
icode approvals revoke GRANT_ID              # remove one approval by its ID from the list
icode approvals clear --project /work/demo   # remove all approvals for one project
icode approvals clear --session SESSION_ID   # remove all approvals for one session
icode approvals clear --all                  # remove everything
```

Approvals for a session are deleted with that session and are not copied to a branch you create with `/fork`. Approvals for a project stay until you remove them.

## Understand automatic approval and safety protections

The following operations usually run without an approval dialog:

- Safe, read-only Shell commands that do not access sensitive targets, such as `ls`, `cat`, and `grep`.
- File writes within the working directory's Git repository that do not access sensitive targets.

Shell commands and file reads or writes that access sensitive targets such as `.env` files, credentials, and private keys still go through approval, even for read-only operations or writes within a Git working directory. This protection applies in manual and automatic modes. Bypass mode skips these approval protections.

Skill scripts run locally with the current user's permissions, without sandbox isolation, so they request approval by default. When the session uses bypass mode, skill scripts run without asking. Before installing or running a third-party skill, review its `SKILL.md`, scripts, and related files to make sure they are trustworthy.

Web tools send requests to outside services, so the `web_search` and `web_fetch` kinds also request approval by default, even when the agent's `approval.default` is `auto`. Explicit `approval.overrides` rules for these kinds or tool names still take precedence. In automatic mode the approval judge model may approve them, and in bypass mode they run without asking. See [Configure web tools](./web-tools.md#approve-web-tool-calls).

## Verify approval modes in the TUI

Select the built-in Code agent, then submit this request:

```text
Use the Shell tool to run icode --version
```

This command only displays the version and does not modify files, but it is not among the read-only Shell commands approved automatically. Expect the following results:

- In manual mode, the **Approval Required** dialog opens. After approval, the iCode version is displayed.
- In automatic mode, **Reviewing** appears to the left of the approval mode label while the approval judge model evaluates the command. The model will usually judge it safe, and the iCode version is displayed without an approval dialog. If the model flags it as suspicious, the dialog shows the evaluation reason and waits for a decision.
- In bypass mode, the command runs and displays the iCode version without an approval dialog.

## Approval modes in other ways of running iCode

Other ways of running iCode use the following approval modes and switching methods:

- **Headless CLI (`icode run`)**: Always bypasses approval and provides no approval-related options.
- **iCode ACP server**: Defaults to manual mode. Use `icode acp --approval manual|auto|bypass` to set the initial mode. ACP clients that support this capability can also switch the current session's mode.
- **Browser-hosted TUI (`icode serve`)**: Use the TUI operations described earlier to switch approval modes and handle approval requests.

## Set the ACP human approval timeout

Press **F10** → **Settings** → **Security**, then set **ACP human approval timeout (seconds)** in the **Approval** section. The default is **600 seconds**; values below **1** are adjusted to **1**. Restart the ACP server after saving.

The timer starts when ACP requests human approval. If no response arrives before the timeout, iCode rejects that tool call. This setting does not limit TUI human approvals or the time the approval judge model spends evaluating a call; the judge uses its model request timeout.
